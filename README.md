Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
  DriverPass is a company that wants to offer a better way for drivers to learn how to drive and pass their driving test at the DMV. DriverPass wanted to offer their services online. These services included take classes and test, as well as making reservations for their in person driving school.

What did you do particularly well?
  I was particularly proud of my Gantt chart. Breaking down the timelines and responsibilities in a visual manner was satisfying and productive.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
  I would revise my Use Case diagram. I missed some key elements and actors. I would add those in and make sure nothing else was missed.
  
How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
  I interpreted the users needs as the absolutes. If the client ask for it, then they are going to get it. It's not optional if it's too hard or hasn't been done before. Clients needs are the reason we are in business and if we don't do our job here there will be no repeat business and no word of mouth reputation. I also would not be honoring my word of delivering what I promised.
  
How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
  Measure twice, cut one. The major lift of software design is fully understanding the request and needs of the client. You have to get that right, or you'll end up in an endless cycle of revisions until you're either fired or a very unhappy client just settles. The interview method in the beginning of the process is important so you have the clients words written down to go off of.
